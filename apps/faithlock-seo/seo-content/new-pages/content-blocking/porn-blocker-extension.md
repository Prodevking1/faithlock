## Key Takeaways

- A porn blocker extension filters one browser on one computer. Everything outside that browser, including every app and every other browser, is untouched.
- Chrome extensions do not run in Incognito windows unless you explicitly allow it, and removal takes a right click.
- There are two situations where an extension is genuinely correct: a managed work computer where you cannot change system settings, and as one layer among several.
- If you install only one thing, filtering DNS covers more ground for the same effort. An extension is a supplement.

## How a Porn Blocker Extension Works

An extension runs inside the browser and inspects each page request before it completes. Because it lives above the network layer, it can see the full address rather than just the domain, so it can filter a specific page on a site whose other pages are fine. That is the one thing extensions do better than DNS filtering, and it is a real advantage.

Everything else about the position is a limitation.

## The Four Gaps, Stated Up Front

**One browser.** An extension installed in Chrome does nothing in Firefox, Safari, or Edge. Installing another browser takes under a minute and requires no permissions.

**No apps.** Extensions never see traffic from apps. Given how much of the content people are trying to filter arrives inside ordinary apps rather than through a browser, this gap alone rules out an extension as a sole defense.

**Private windows.** Extensions do not run in Incognito mode unless specifically granted permission. Chrome's own documentation is clear that "You can't add extensions when you browse in Incognito mode or as a guest", with a separate "Allow in incognito" setting to enable it ([Chrome Web Store Help](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769), checked 2026-08-16). If you install an extension for this purpose and skip that toggle, you have installed almost nothing.

**Trivial removal.** Right click the icon near the address bar, select "Remove from Chrome", and it is gone. No passcode, no notification, no record.

That last one is the decisive limitation for anyone installing a filter on themselves, and it is why accountability oriented products bolt their extension onto a service that notices when it disappears.

## When an Extension Is Actually Right

Two situations, and they are narrower than the category's marketing suggests.

**A work computer you do not administer.** If IT owns the device, you may be unable to change DNS settings, install a VPN profile, or touch system level controls. An extension may be the only layer available to you, and a partial layer beats none.

**As layer three or four.** Filtering DNS on the network, the operating system restriction on each device, and then an extension for URL level precision inside the browser you actually use. In that stack the extension's weaknesses are covered by the layers underneath it.

Where an extension is the wrong answer: as the only thing you install, on a phone, or as a defense against your own future decisions.

## Extensions Attached to an Accountability Service

The more durable version of this idea is an extension that reports rather than blocks, tied to an account that notices when it stops working.

Accountable2You publishes a Chrome extension as part of its monitoring service, which logs browsing including private browsing activity and sends reports to partners you choose. Its Chrome Web Store reviews are worth reading before you commit, including one describing having to uninstall and reinstall it daily without support resolving the issue ([Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/accountable2you/efbfdmcbmjkdkhopodcpmajcdbkiljaa/reviews), checked 2026-08-16).

Truple also ships a Chrome extension alongside its desktop coverage, as part of a screenshot based accountability product rather than a blocker (verified on the vendor's own platform documentation, checked 2026-08-16).

The pattern worth noticing: the serious products in this space treat the extension as a sensor attached to a service, not as a wall. That is the correct way to think about the format.

## Setting One Up Properly

If you are going to use an extension, four steps rather than one:

1. Install it in every browser present on the machine, not just your usual one.
2. Open its details page and enable "Allow in incognito". Skipping this is the single most common mistake.
3. Remove or block the browsers you do not need, so the extension's coverage matches the machine's.
4. Pair it with filtering DNS so that anything outside the browser is still covered. Free resolvers are listed in [free porn blocker](/resources/free-porn-blocker).

Step four is the one that changes the outcome. An extension plus DNS filtering is a real configuration. An extension alone is a gesture.

## What This Does Not Address

An extension changes what a browser will load. It does not change wanting, and it is not treatment. If repeated attempts have not moved the pattern, and it is affecting sleep, work, or a relationship, the useful next step is a clinician rather than another add-on. The [Psychology Today therapist directory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) filters by concern and location.

If any of this is bound up with thoughts of self-harm or a crisis of any kind, that comes first. In the US, the [988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/) is free, 24/7, by call, text, or chat.

## A Note on Phones

There is no meaningful equivalent of a porn blocker extension on iPhone. Safari supports content blocking extensions, but the deeper filtering on iOS happens through Screen Time's web content restriction or a network extension, both of which reach further than any browser add-on. Start there instead: [porn blocker for iPhone](/resources/porn-blocker-iphone).

[FaithLock](/) is worth naming only to set it aside. It is an iOS app that shields apps you choose using Apple's Family Controls API, with a Bible verse quiz required to reopen one. It is not a browser extension, not a content filter, and it does not exist on desktop or Android.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is there a porn blocker extension for Chrome?**
Yes, several, including extensions attached to accountability services such as Accountable2You and Truple. Before installing one, understand that it covers Chrome only, does nothing for apps, and comes off with a right click unless it is tied to a service that reports its own removal.

**Can a porn blocker extension be removed?**
Easily. Right click the icon and select "Remove from Chrome". Extensions that resist this do so through enterprise policy on a managed device, or by belonging to a service that alerts a partner when they stop reporting.

**Do porn blocker extensions work in Incognito mode?**
Not by default. Chrome extensions are disabled in Incognito unless you turn on "Allow in incognito" in the extension's details page. This is the most frequently missed step in this entire setup.

**What is the best porn blocker extension?**
The most useful framing is which service it is attached to, since the extension itself is the weakest part of any of these products. If you want reporting, choose the accountability service first and accept its extension. If you want blocking, filtering DNS covers more for less effort.

**Is a porn blocker extension enough on its own?**
No. It leaves apps, other browsers, and every phone in the house uncovered. Treat it as one layer in a stack that starts with network filtering.
