## Key Takeaways

- Android's native filtering lives in Family Link, not in Digital Wellbeing. Digital Wellbeing manages time and does no content filtering at all.
- Google publishes its own ceiling: "No filter is perfect, but this should help hide sexually explicit sites."
- Filtering DNS is the strongest free layer on Android and covers every app, not just Chrome.
- Almost every accountability product works better on Android than on iPhone, because Android permits system level screen access that Apple does not. If you have a choice of platform for this purpose, Android is the easier one to cover.

## The Three Native Layers, and What Each One Is For

Android spreads this across three separate places, which is the main reason people conclude it does not have a porn blocker. It does. It is just not where you would look.

### Family Link: the actual content filter

This is the one that filters. Open the Family Link app, select the person, tap Controls then Google Chrome and Web, and choose from three options ([Google For Families Help](https://support.google.com/families/answer/7087030), checked 2026-08-16):

- **Allow all sites**, everything except sites you specifically block
- **Try to block explicit sites**, which attempts to hide sexually explicit content
- **Only allow approved sites**, an allowlist where nothing else loads

You can also manage individual sites under Approved sites and Blocked sites. When a site is blocked, the person can request access through "Ask in person" on Android and Chromebooks, or "Ask in a message" on any device.

Google states the limit itself, and the wording is worth taking literally: "No filter is perfect, but this should help hide sexually explicit sites." Note the verb. Hide, not prevent.

The other limitation is scope. This filters Chrome. Another browser installed from the Play Store is a different application and this setting does not reach it.

### SafeSearch: narrower than people assume

SafeSearch has three settings: Filter, which blocks explicit results, Blur, which blurs explicit images while allowing text results, and Off. It is the default for signed-in users under 18, and it can be locked by a parent through Family Link, by a school, or by a device or network administrator.

Google is explicit about the boundary: "SafeSearch only works on Google Search. It doesn't affect content on other search engines or websites" ([Google Search Help](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/510), checked 2026-08-16).

Turn it on, and lock it if you administer the network. Then treat it as having removed one on-ramp, not as filtering anything.

### Digital Wellbeing: not a filter at all

Worth stating clearly because the name misleads. Digital Wellbeing offers app timers, where the app "closes and its icon dims" when the limit is reached and timers reset at midnight, plus Focus mode which pauses selected apps and their notifications, and Bedtime mode ([Google Support](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9346420), checked 2026-08-16).

None of that filters content. It is a time tool. It becomes relevant here only in the specific case where the pattern is time and idleness driven rather than search driven, which is a real pattern and covered further down.

## The Layer That Does the Most: Filtering DNS

Native controls filter Chrome. Filtering DNS filters everything on the connection, in any app and any browser, and it is free.

| Service | Addresses | What it blocks |
|---|---|---|
| CleanBrowsing Family Filter | 185.228.168.168 and 185.228.169.168 | Adult sites, proxy and VPN domains, mixed content sites, SafeSearch enforced |
| Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 for Families | 1.1.1.3 and 1.0.0.3 | Malware and adult content |
| AdGuard family protection | 94.140.14.15 and 94.140.15.16 | Ads, trackers, adult content, Safe Search where possible |

CleanBrowsing documents its free tier as requiring no account but throttled and unsupported ([CleanBrowsing](https://cleanbrowsing.org/filters/)). Cloudflare describes its family option as free protection for home Internet ([Cloudflare](https://one.one.one.one/family/)). AdGuard describes its family servers as blocking "ads, trackers, adult content, and enable Safe Search and Safe Mode, where possible" ([AdGuard DNS](https://adguard-dns.io/en/public-dns.html)). All checked 2026-08-16.

Of the three, CleanBrowsing's Family Filter is the one to choose here, because blocking proxy and VPN domains closes the first workaround anyone tries.

Android also supports Private DNS at the system level, which applies on mobile data as well as Wi-Fi. That is a meaningful advantage over a router-only filter, which stops protecting the moment the phone leaves the house.

## Why Android Coverage Beats iPhone Coverage

This is the part most buying guides skip, and it changes which product you should choose.

Accountability products capture what is on screen. Android permits an app to do this at the system level; iOS does not. The consequences are documented by the vendors themselves.

Covenant Eyes takes AI-analyzed screenshots on Android, Windows and macOS and sends them in a report, while on iOS its screenshot capture narrows to Safari ([TechLockdown](https://www.techlockdown.com/articles/covenant-eyes-iphone-review), checked 2026-08-16). Truple captures random screenshots of the whole device on Android using system level access, whereas on iOS it goes through the screen broadcast permission and requires separate companion apps rather than a Truple branded one, with the company stating plainly that its iOS solutions are creative workarounds for Apple's limitations ([Truple support](https://support.truple.io/articles/ios/why-iphone-app-is-designed-the-way-it-is), checked 2026-08-16). Bark needs a physical accessory to monitor an iPhone at all, while on Android it works from software ([Bark support](https://support.bark.us/en/articles/13928365-how-to-monitor-ios-devices-with-the-bark-sync), checked 2026-08-16).

Truple also uses device admin based locking on Android to make uninstallation harder, which has no iOS equivalent.

The practical conclusion: if you are choosing a device for a person who needs this kind of coverage, Android is the easier platform to cover properly. That is an unusual thing to conclude about Android and privacy, and it follows directly from the same permissiveness that makes Android weaker in other respects.

## A Sensible Free Android Setup

1. Set Private DNS to a filtering resolver, so the filter travels on mobile data.
2. Turn on Family Link's "Try to block explicit sites" for Chrome.
3. Turn on SafeSearch and lock it if you can.
4. Remove alternative browsers you do not need, since the Chrome filter does not reach them.
5. Have someone else hold the Family Link credentials.

Steps one through four take about fifteen minutes. Step five is the one that determines whether any of it lasts.

## Where a Paid Product Is Justified

Only when you need something the free stack cannot do:

- **A report sent to a person.** Covenant Eyes, Accountable2You, or Truple. Accountable2You states plainly that it does not block, logs browsing including private browsing, and allows unlimited partners per device.
- **Alerts about content sent to a child by someone else.** Bark scans messages and social platforms and alerts a parent, which no filter does.
- **Image level rather than site level filtering.** Canopy classifies in real time and blurs individual images, at a documented cost in speed and false positives.

## One Honest Note About FaithLock

**FaithLock does not run on Android.** It is iOS only, there is no Android version, and it is not a content filter on any platform.

Naming it here so nobody arrives at an app store expecting to find it. If you are on Android and looking for adult content filtering, the free stack above plus one of the accountability products is the realistic path.

If you also use an iPhone, and the difficulty there is habitual app opening rather than content filtering, [FaithLock](/) shields chosen apps using Apple's Family Controls API and requires a Bible verse quiz to reopen one.

## When Software Is Not the Answer

Filtering changes what is easy to reach. It does not change wanting, and it is not treatment. If repeated attempts have not shifted the pattern and it is costing sleep, work, or a relationship, a clinician is the useful next step rather than another app. The [Psychology Today therapist directory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) filters by concern and location.

If any of this involves thoughts of self-harm or a crisis of any kind, that comes first. In the US, the [988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/) is free, 24/7, by call, text, or chat.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does Android have a built-in porn blocker?**
Yes, through Family Link rather than through the phone's own settings menu. Under Controls, then Google Chrome and Web, "Try to block explicit sites" filters Chrome. It does not reach other browsers or apps, which is what filtering DNS is for.

**What is the best free porn blocker for Android?**
Private DNS pointed at a filtering resolver, because it applies to every app and works on mobile data as well as Wi-Fi. CleanBrowsing's Family Filter is the strongest free choice since it also blocks proxy and VPN domains. Pair it with Family Link's Chrome filter.

**How do I block adult websites on Android permanently?**
Nothing is permanent on a device whose owner can reach the settings. The durable version is filtering DNS plus Family Link, with the account credentials held by another person, which converts a setting you control into one you do not.

**Do porn blockers work better on Android than iPhone?**
Generally yes, for accountability products specifically. Android permits system level screen capture and device admin locking, so Covenant Eyes, Truple and Bark all cover more on Android than on iOS, as each vendor's own documentation describes.

**Can Digital Wellbeing block adult content?**
No. Digital Wellbeing manages time through app timers, Focus mode and Bedtime mode, and does no content filtering. Use Family Link and filtering DNS for content.
