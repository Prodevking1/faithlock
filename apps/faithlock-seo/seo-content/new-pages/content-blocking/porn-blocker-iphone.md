meta_description: "Apple's current Web Content path, verified against Apple's own documentation, what Limit Adult Websites genuinely covers, and the exact point where a third party tool earns its cost."

## Key Takeaways

- iPhone ships with a web content filter. It is free, system wide, and most people looking for a porn blocker for iPhone do not know it is there.
- Apple has renamed the path. The setting now sits behind **App Store, Media, Web, & Games**, and the third option is **Only Approved Websites**, not the older "Allowed Websites Only". Instructions written more than a couple of years ago will send you to a menu that no longer exists.
- The native filter's strength is entirely the Screen Time passcode. If you know the code, you have a preference, not a control.
- A third party tool is worth paying for at exactly one point: when you need coverage the native filter does not give, or a report to another person.

## Start With What Apple Already Gives You

Apple documents the current path as follows: open the Settings app, scroll down, then tap Screen Time; tap Content & Privacy Restrictions; enter your Screen Time passcode if asked; tap App Store, Media, Web, & Games, then tap Web Content; choose Unrestricted, Limit Adult Websites, or Only Approved Websites ([Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105121), checked 2026-08-16).

Apple writes those steps for a parent managing a child through Family Sharing, so its version includes one extra tap, "Under Family, tap your child's name", immediately after Screen Time. On your own device that step simply does not apply and the rest is identical.

Two details worth flagging because they trip people up:

- The intermediate screen is called **App Store, Media, Web, & Games**. Guides still telling you to look for "Content Restrictions" are describing a previous version of the menu.
- The strictest option is **Only Approved Websites**, an allowlist where nothing loads except sites you add. It is a blunt instrument and the correct choice for a young child's device, not for an adult's.

Setting **Limit Adult Websites** is the option most readers want. It applies to web content system wide rather than to Safari alone.

## The Limit That Decides Everything

The native filter is exactly as strong as the secrecy of the Screen Time passcode.

That is not a criticism of Apple's implementation. It is the design: a control the device owner can lift. Which means, for an adult installing this on themselves, the software question is nearly irrelevant and the real question is who sets the code.

If somebody else sets that passcode and does not tell you, iPhone's free filter becomes more durable than most paid products, because reversing it now requires a conversation. If you set it yourself, you have installed a speed bump you can remove in fifteen seconds during the exact moment you are least inclined to respect it.

This is the single highest leverage step on this page, and it costs nothing. Everything below is about the cases where it is genuinely not enough.

## What the Native Filter Does Not Cover

Four gaps, in the order they matter:

**Content arriving through messages.** A filter acts on requests your device makes. Something another person sends you was never requested, so no filter sees it. This gap is real and no iOS product closes it cleanly. An independent tester demonstrated exactly this against Covenant Eyes on iPhone, receiving suggestive images by message without an alert firing ([Cranky Old Dan](https://crankyolddan.substack.com/p/you-cant-hide-those-covenant-eyes), checked 2026-08-16).

**In-app content.** Apple's web content restriction acts on web content. Material inside an app's own feed is a different surface.

**No reporting.** The native filter tells nobody anything, ever. If it is switched off, no record exists and no one is notified. For anyone whose plan depends on another person knowing, this is the gap that justifies paying.

**Classification precision.** Limit Adult Websites is a category judgment. It will occasionally block something ordinary and occasionally miss something it should not.

## Adding Filtering DNS, Still Free

Before paying anyone, add the second free layer. Set the phone's DNS to a filtering resolver and every app and browser on that connection is covered, not just web content.

Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 for Families offers malware and adult content filtering at 1.1.1.3 and 1.0.0.3, described as free ([Cloudflare](https://one.one.one.one/family/)). CleanBrowsing's free Family Filter at 185.228.168.168 and 185.228.169.168 additionally blocks proxy and VPN domains, which closes a common workaround, though the free tier is documented as throttled and unsupported ([CleanBrowsing](https://cleanbrowsing.org/filters/)). Both checked 2026-08-16.

Set on the home router, this covers every device in the house. Set on the phone itself, it travels with the phone. The router version does nothing once the phone is on cellular data, which is worth knowing before you rely on it.

## When a Paid iPhone Tool Earns Its Cost

Three situations, and no others.

**You need coverage across apps and a real anti-bypass measure.** Canopy runs a network extension on iOS, installed as a VPN profile visible under Settings, VPN & Device Management, and blocks third party VPNs so the usual workaround fails ([Canopy support](https://support.canopy.us/portal/en/kb/articles/canopy-shield-ios-installation), checked 2026-08-16). It is the strongest technical option on iPhone. Its own reviewers report overblocking, heavy battery and data use, and slowdown severe enough to interfere with normal use ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canopy-ai-online-safety-app/id1492266682), [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/canopy.us), checked 2026-08-16). Full assessment in [Canopy porn blocker review](/resources/canopy-porn-blocker-review).

**You need someone else to be told.** Covenant Eyes uses a filtering VPN on iOS that blocks adult content at the network level across the device, plus a Safari extension that captures screenshots. Be precise about the boundary: the VPN filters device wide, while the screenshot reporting is limited to Safari, so other browsers and apps are filtered but not reported ([TechLockdown](https://www.techlockdown.com/articles/covenant-eyes-iphone-review), checked 2026-08-16).

**You are monitoring a child rather than filtering yourself.** Bark alerts a parent to risky content across messages and social platforms, but on iOS Apple blocks third party apps from reading messages directly, so Bark relies on a physical accessory that scans the device when plugged in. Coverage is therefore periodic rather than continuous ([Bark support](https://support.bark.us/en/articles/13928365-how-to-monitor-ios-devices-with-the-bark-sync), checked 2026-08-16).

Notice the pattern across all three. Apple's restrictions on what third party apps may do are why every iOS product here is either a VPN, a Safari-limited extension, or a hardware workaround. Any iPhone tool claiming full unrestricted visibility is describing something the platform does not permit.

## Where FaithLock Fits, Precisely

**FaithLock is not a porn blocker and does not filter web content.** If content filtering is what you came for, everything above is the relevant part of this page.

[FaithLock](/) is an iOS app that shields apps you choose using Apple's Family Controls API, the same system framework behind Screen Time. Reopening a shielded app requires reading a Bible verse and answering a fill-in-the-blank question about it, drawn from the complete Berean Standard Bible library of 31,000 or more verses. It also tracks Scripture and prayer streaks and includes guided audio prayers and written prayer journaling.

It addresses one specific pattern: the unthinking reach for an app out of boredom or habit. If your difficulty is that a browser will load anything, use the filter. If your difficulty is that your thumb opens something before you have decided to, this is the layer that intervenes there.

## If This Goes Beyond Settings

Filtering changes availability, not wanting, and it is not treatment. If repeated attempts have not moved the pattern and it is costing sleep, work, or a relationship, the next step is a clinician. The [Psychology Today therapist directory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) filters by concern and location, and many list sliding scale fees.

If any of this involves thoughts of self-harm, hopelessness, or a crisis of any kind, that comes first. In the US, the [988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/) is free, 24/7, by call, text, or chat, in English and Spanish.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does iPhone have a built-in porn blocker?**
Yes. Screen Time includes a Web Content restriction with a Limit Adult Websites option, applied system wide to web content, and it is free. Apple's current path is Settings, Screen Time, Content & Privacy Restrictions, App Store, Media, Web, & Games, then Web Content.

**What is the best porn blocker for iPhone?**
For an adult filtering their own phone, the built-in restriction with the passcode held by someone else, which costs nothing. Where you need coverage across apps and resistance to bypass, Canopy is the strongest paid option on iOS. Where you need a report sent to a partner, Covenant Eyes.

**Can you block adult content on iPhone without an app?**
Yes, entirely. The Screen Time web content restriction plus a filtering DNS resolver covers web content system wide and reaches apps, with no third party app installed and nothing paid.

**How do I block adult websites on iPhone permanently?**
Nothing on a personal iPhone is permanent, because the device owner can always lift a restriction. The closest realistic version is turning on Limit Adult Websites and having another person set the Screen Time passcode without telling you.

**Why do porn blockers work worse on iPhone than Android?**
Apple prevents third party apps from reading messages, photos, or other apps' content. Products therefore work around it with a filtering VPN, a Safari-only extension, or an external accessory. Truple states this directly about its own iOS design ([Truple support](https://support.truple.io/articles/ios/why-iphone-app-is-designed-the-way-it-is), checked 2026-08-16).
