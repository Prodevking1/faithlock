## Key Takeaways

- "Porn blocker" describes at least five different mechanisms that fail in five different ways. Picking the wrong one is the most common reason people conclude that filtering does not work.
- The two strongest categories on a phone are network level filtering and operating system content restrictions. Both are free to start with. Neither is airtight.
- Accountability software is sold in the same aisle but does the opposite thing: it blocks nothing and reports everything to a person you choose.
- Every one of these tools is bypassable by the person who controls the passcode. That is a design fact, not a defect, and it changes what you should expect from software.

## What a Porn Blocker Actually Does

A porn blocker sits somewhere between you and a request your device is about to make, and refuses to complete it. Where it sits determines everything: what it can see, what it covers, and how it comes apart.

Five places it can sit:

| Mechanism | Where it intercepts | Covers | Typical failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| DNS filtering | The lookup that turns a name into an address | Every app and browser on that network or device | Change the DNS setting, or use a network that has none |
| Filtering VPN or network extension | All device traffic, routed through a filter | Whole device, including apps | Delete the profile; performance cost; overblocking |
| OS content restriction | Built into the phone, behind a passcode | Web content system wide | Whoever knows the passcode turns it off |
| Browser extension | Inside one browser on one computer | That browser only | Another browser, incognito, or two clicks to remove |
| Accountability reporting | Nothing. It observes and reports | Depends on the product | Blocks nothing by design |

There is a sixth thing people often mean, which is app blocking: preventing a specific app from opening at all. That is a different job, and it is worth naming because a lot of adult content arrives through ordinary apps rather than through a browser. We come back to that below.

## The Mechanisms, One at a Time

### DNS filtering

Before your device loads anything, it asks a DNS resolver to turn a domain name into an address. Point that lookup at a resolver that refuses to answer for adult domains and the content never loads, in any browser, in any app on that connection.

This is the cheapest strong option, and several resolvers are free. Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 for Families offers a malware and adult content option at 1.1.1.3 and 1.0.0.3, described as free protection for your home Internet ([Cloudflare](https://one.one.one.one/family/), checked 2026-08-16). CleanBrowsing publishes a free Family Filter at 185.228.168.168 and 185.228.169.168 that blocks adult sites plus proxy and VPN domains and enforces SafeSearch, with the free tier documented as throttled and unsupported ([CleanBrowsing](https://cleanbrowsing.org/filters/), checked 2026-08-16). AdGuard's family protection servers at 94.140.14.15 and 94.140.15.16 block "ads, trackers, adult content, and enable Safe Search and Safe Mode, where possible" ([AdGuard DNS](https://adguard-dns.io/en/public-dns.html), checked 2026-08-16).

**How it fails:** DNS is a setting, and settings can be changed. On an unmanaged phone, switching resolvers takes under a minute. Cellular data usually bypasses a router level filter entirely. And DNS works at the domain level, so it cannot distinguish between parts of a site that hosts everything.

### Filtering VPN or network extension

Instead of only intercepting the lookup, this routes traffic through a filter that inspects it. On iOS this shows up as a VPN profile in Settings. Canopy works this way and additionally blocks third party VPNs to stop the obvious workaround. Covenant Eyes uses a filtering VPN on iOS that acts at the network level across the device.

**How it fails:** the profile can be deleted unless the device is supervised. It costs battery and speed, and Canopy users report both overblocking of ordinary content and slowdown severe enough to interfere with normal use ([Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/canopy.us), [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canopy-ai-online-safety-app/id1492266682), checked 2026-08-16). Real time classification also means real time mistakes in both directions.

### Operating system content restriction

Both mobile platforms ship a filter. On iPhone it lives in Screen Time under Content & Privacy Restrictions, where Web Content can be set to Limit Adult Websites. On Android, Family Link offers "Try to block explicit sites" for Chrome. Both are free, both are already installed, and both are the correct first step before spending money.

**How it fails:** the passcode. An OS restriction is exactly as strong as the secrecy of the code that unlocks it, which is why handing that code to someone else is the single highest leverage move available to an adult using this method. Google is unusually direct about the ceiling here: "No filter is perfect, but this should help hide sexually explicit sites" ([Google For Families Help](https://support.google.com/families/answer/7087030), checked 2026-08-16).

Step by step for each platform: [porn blocker for iPhone](/resources/porn-blocker-iphone) and [porn blocker for Android](/resources/porn-blocker-android).

### Browser extension

An extension filters inside one browser on one computer. It is the fastest thing to install and the weakest thing to rely on, mostly because of scope. Chrome extensions do not run in Incognito windows by default, and removal is a right click and "Remove from Chrome" ([Chrome Web Store Help](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769), checked 2026-08-16).

Extensions earn their place when they are one layer among several, or when the concern is a work laptop where you cannot change network settings. Detail in [porn blocker extension](/resources/porn-blocker-extension).

### Accountability reporting

This category is worth understanding precisely because it is often shelved beside blockers and does the opposite. Accountable2You describes itself as a monitoring tool rather than a blocking one, logging browsing including private browsing and sending reports to partners you nominate. Covenant Eyes takes AI analyzed screenshots on Android, Windows and macOS and sends a report. Truple captures random screenshots of the whole device and shares them with a chosen partner.

**How it fails:** it does not block, so there is nothing to bypass. Its entire strength is another person's attention, which means it fails when that person stops reading, or when nobody was ever really chosen. Covered properly in [accountability software](/resources/accountability-software) and [porn blocker vs accountability](/resources/porn-blocker-vs-accountability).

## Choosing Based on the Actual Situation

| Situation | Reasonable starting point |
|---|---|
| Your own phone, you want friction | OS content restriction with the passcode held by someone else |
| Your own laptop, work managed | Browser extension plus filtering DNS if permitted |
| Whole household, several devices | Filtering DNS at the router, then per device settings |
| A child's device | Platform parental controls first, third party filter if those prove insufficient |
| You do not want a block, you want honesty | Accountability software, and a real person who agrees to read it |
| The pull is strongest when bored or idle | App blocking on the apps that carry the boredom |

## What No Porn Blocker Does

Worth stating plainly, because the marketing in this category rarely does.

Filtering software changes availability. It does not change wanting, and it is not treatment. It cannot see inside encrypted messaging, it cannot classify what it never sees, and it cannot help at all with content that arrives from another person rather than from a site.

An independent tester documented exactly this gap with Covenant Eyes on iPhone, downloading a dating app and receiving suggestive images through messages without an alert firing ([Cranky Old Dan](https://crankyolddan.substack.com/p/you-cant-hide-those-covenant-eyes), checked 2026-08-16). That is not a story about one product being bad. It is what the mechanism can and cannot reach.

If compulsive use is costing you sleep, work, or a relationship, and you have tried and failed at this repeatedly, the useful next step is a clinician rather than another app. The [Psychology Today therapist directory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) filters by concern and location, and many therapists list sliding scale fees.

## If You Are in Crisis

If any of this is tangled up with thoughts of self-harm, hopelessness, or a crisis of any kind, that comes first. In the US, the [988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/) is available by call, text, or chat, 24/7, in English and Spanish, with free one-on-one support.

## Where FaithLock Fits, and Where It Does Not

Straight answer, because this page would be worse if it pretended otherwise: **FaithLock is not a porn blocker.** It does not filter web content, it does not classify images, and it does not send reports to an accountability partner. If adult content filtering is what you came for, use one of the mechanisms above.

What it does is a narrower job. [FaithLock](/) is an iOS app that shields apps you choose using Apple's Family Controls API, and reopening one requires reading a Bible verse and answering a fill-in-the-blank question about it, drawn from the complete Berean Standard Bible library of 31,000 or more verses. That is useful for the pattern where the reach happens out of boredom or habit rather than intent, because it puts a deliberate act between the impulse and the app. It is a habit tool, not a filter, and it does not exist on Android.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the best porn blocker?**
There is no single answer, because the mechanisms cover different ground. For a whole household, filtering DNS at the router reaches the most devices for the least money. For one phone, the built-in OS restriction with the passcode held by someone else is stronger than most paid apps. See [best porn blocker](/resources/best-porn-blocker) for the choice by situation.

**Can a porn blocker be bypassed?**
Yes, all of them, by the person who controls the device and its passcode. Filters raise the cost of an action rather than making it impossible. The practical response is not a stricter product but removing your own ability to undo it, usually by giving the passcode to somebody else.

**Is there a free porn blocker that actually works?**
The free options that hold up are the filters already built into iOS and Android, and free public DNS resolvers. What free does not usually buy you is reporting, tamper resistance, or support. [Free porn blocker](/resources/free-porn-blocker) goes through each one and what it leaves uncovered.

**Do porn blockers work on apps, or only websites?**
It depends on the mechanism. DNS filtering and filtering VPNs act on traffic, so they reach apps. Browser extensions and SafeSearch style filters do not. This gap matters more than most buyers realize, since a large share of the exposure people are trying to prevent arrives inside ordinary apps.

**Does a porn blocker stop content sent in messages?**
Generally no. Messaging is encrypted and content delivered by another person never passes through a filterable lookup. Tools that address this at all do so by looking at the screen rather than the network, which is monitoring rather than blocking.
