## Verdict First

**Choose a porn blocker if** the difficulty is availability: something is reachable in a moment when you would rather it were not, and you want the moment to fail. It works immediately, without another person, and it works at the exact moment of the impulse.

**Choose accountability software if** the difficulty is secrecy: you have installed and removed several filters, and the thing that would actually change the decision is somebody knowing. It does nothing in the moment and everything afterward.

**Run both if** the pattern is impulsive and you have someone willing to read the reports. This is the configuration most vendors are quietly selling, and it is the right one for many people.

**Neither, yet, if** you have not turned on the free filter your phone already has. Start there, then decide.

## The Core Difference

| | Porn blocker | Accountability software |
|---|---|---|
| What it does | Prevents access | Permits access, reports it |
| When it acts | At the moment of the request | After the fact |
| Depends on | Software and a passcode | A specific person reading the report |
| Works alone | Yes | No |
| Reaches content sent by others | No | Yes, if screenshot based |
| Overblocks legitimate content | Sometimes, and it is a real cost | Never, it does not intervene |
| Privacy cost | Low | High, especially screenshot based tools |
| Typical bypass | Change the setting, use another network | None needed, nothing is blocked |
| Fails when | You hold the passcode | Nobody reads the report |

That last row is the whole comparison. Each mechanism has one dominant failure, and they are entirely different failures. Choosing well means picking the failure you are less likely to produce.

## How Each One Works

### Blocking

A filter intercepts a request and refuses it. It can sit at the DNS lookup, inside a filtering VPN or network extension, at the operating system level, or inside a browser. Coverage depends entirely on where it sits, which is covered mechanism by mechanism in [porn blocker](/resources/porn-blocker).

The appeal is that it needs no one else and it acts at the moment that matters. The limitation is structural: on a personal device, the person who controls the passcode can lift the restriction, and that person is usually the person the filter is for.

### Accountability

A monitoring tool logs activity or captures screenshots, classifies what looks relevant, and sends a report to people you nominate. Accountable2You states plainly that it is not a blocking tool, logging browsing including private browsing and offering unlimited partners per device. Truple captures random screenshots of the whole device and shares them. Covenant Eyes takes AI-analyzed screenshots on Android, Windows and macOS and reports them, while on iOS it adds a filtering VPN that does block at the network level (verified in vendor documentation, checked 2026-08-16).

The appeal is that there is nothing to bypass, since nothing is blocked, and it reaches content a filter never sees. The limitation is that its entire strength is another person's attention.

## Winner by Category

### Coverage: accountability, narrowly

A filter acts on requests your device makes. Something another person sends you was never requested, so no filter sees it. An independent tester demonstrated this against Covenant Eyes on iPhone, installing a dating app and receiving suggestive images by message without an alert firing ([Cranky Old Dan](https://crankyolddan.substack.com/p/you-cant-hide-those-covenant-eyes), checked 2026-08-16).

Screenshot based accountability sees whatever is on screen regardless of how it arrived. That is the one area where it genuinely reaches further.

**Caveat:** on iPhone this advantage largely evaporates. Covenant Eyes captures screenshots in Safari only ([TechLockdown](https://www.techlockdown.com/articles/covenant-eyes-iphone-review)), Truple requires separate companion apps and describes its own iOS solutions as workarounds for Apple's limitations ([Truple support](https://support.truple.io/articles/ios/why-iphone-app-is-designed-the-way-it-is)), and Bark needs a physical accessory that only scans when plugged in ([Bark support](https://support.bark.us/en/articles/13928365-how-to-monitor-ios-devices-with-the-bark-sync)). All checked 2026-08-16. On Android the advantage is real. On iPhone it is much thinner than the marketing suggests.

### Acting in the moment: blocking, decisively

Reporting is retrospective by design. If the thing you want is for the next ten seconds to go differently, only a filter does that. This is not a small distinction: for impulsive patterns it is the entire difference between the two categories.

### Resistance to your own future self: it depends on one variable

Blocking loses if you hold the passcode, which is the default and the reason most people conclude filters do not work. Blocking wins as soon as someone else holds it, and at that point it outperforms accountability, because it prevents rather than reports.

Accountability partly closes this gap by alerting a partner when monitoring is disabled. Whether that works still depends on whether the partner acts on the alert.

### Privacy: blocking, by a wide margin

A filter knows a domain was requested. Screenshot based accountability sees your banking app, your medical portal, your work email, and messages with people who never agreed to be captured. That is not a defect in a specific product, it is what whole-device screen capture means.

Truple's claim of end-to-end encryption is substantive for exactly this reason. Any screenshot based vendor should be asked about encryption at rest, retention, and what happens to the archive when the arrangement ends.

### False positives: accountability, by default

Filters break things. Canopy reviewers report ordinary content blocked and incompatibilities with banking and streaming apps ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canopy-ai-online-safety-app/id1492266682), checked 2026-08-16). Monitoring breaks nothing because it never intervenes, though it produces false alerts of its own: Accountable2You reviewers describe ordinary beach photos flagged as suspicious ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/accountable2you-monitoring/id1531309290), checked 2026-08-16). The difference is that a false alert is an awkward conversation, while a false block is a bank app that will not open.

### Cost: a tie, and both lose to free

Every established product in both categories is subscription only with no permanent free tier. Meanwhile the built-in filters on iOS and Android are free and use the same blocking mechanism as paid filters. There is no free equivalent of accountability software, because the reporting infrastructure is an ongoing cost. See [free porn blocker](/resources/free-porn-blocker).

## The Question That Actually Decides It

Not "which is stronger", but: **when it last went wrong, what would have changed it?**

If the honest answer is "if the page had not loaded", buy a filter, and give the passcode away.

If the honest answer is "if I had known someone would see it", buy accountability, and choose the person before the product.

If the honest answer is "if I had not picked up my phone at eleven at night with nothing to do", neither category is aimed at your problem. That is a habit and idleness pattern, and it is addressed by app level friction and by having something else to do at eleven at night.

## Where FaithLock Sits, and Where It Does Not

That third answer is the only place FaithLock belongs in this comparison. **It is neither a porn blocker nor accountability software.** It does not filter web content, and it reports nothing to anyone.

[FaithLock](/) is an iOS app that shields apps you choose using Apple's Family Controls API, where reopening one requires reading a Bible verse and answering a fill-in-the-blank question about it, drawn from the complete Berean Standard Bible library of 31,000 or more verses. It puts a deliberate act between the impulse and the app, which addresses habitual reaching and nothing else. If you need filtering or reporting, the products above are the relevant ones.

## Neither Category Is Treatment

Both change conditions around a behavior. Neither treats what may sit underneath it, and neither is therapy. If the pattern has survived several genuine attempts and is affecting sleep, work, or a relationship, a clinician is the next step rather than a third subscription. The [Psychology Today therapist directory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) filters by concern and location, and many therapists list sliding scale fees.

If any of this involves thoughts of self-harm, hopelessness, or a crisis of any kind, that comes first. In the US, the [988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/) is free, 24/7, by call, text, or chat, in English and Spanish.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the difference between a porn blocker and accountability software?**
A blocker prevents access. Accountability software permits access and reports it to a person you choose. They fail differently: a blocker fails when you hold the passcode, accountability fails when nobody reads the report.

**Is accountability better than blocking?**
Neither is better in general. Accountability reaches content a filter cannot see and never breaks legitimate sites. Blocking acts in the moment and costs almost nothing in privacy. Match the mechanism to the failure you keep having.

**Can you use a porn blocker and accountability software together?**
Yes, and for impulsive patterns with a willing partner it is the strongest configuration. Covenant Eyes sells both in one subscription, filtering device wide on iOS while reporting through Safari. Otherwise run a free filter alongside a monitoring subscription.

**Does accountability software block anything?**
Generally no, and several vendors say so directly. Accountable2You describes itself as monitoring rather than blocking. The exception is Covenant Eyes on iOS, where a filtering VPN does block at the network level alongside the reporting.

**Which is better for a teenager?**
Usually monitoring with the teenager's knowledge, plus native parental controls, rather than a hard filter installed silently. Controls imposed without explanation tend to produce concealment rather than change, which defeats the purpose of both categories.
