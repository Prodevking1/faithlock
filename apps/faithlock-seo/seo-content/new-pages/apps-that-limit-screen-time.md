meta_description: "An app that limits screen time is only as good as what it does when you hit the limit. 8 compared on that exact moment, with sourced weaknesses."
---

## Key Takeaways

- **The only question that matters**: what happens at the moment you hit the limit. Everything else is a dashboard.
- **Best free limit**: Apple's built-in Screen Time, undone for most people by its Ignore Limit button
- **Best free limit that holds**: ScreenZen, with daily caps, session-length caps, and escalating delays
- **Best time budgets**: Clearspace, though an independent review notes users can raise their own budgets whenever they like
- **Hardest enforcement of a usage limit**: Jomo, which can block on a usage limit and lock it behind Strict Mode
- **Best limit that gives you something back**: FaithLock, where crossing the line means a Bible verse and a question about it
- **Best if rules make you rebel**: Forest or Flora, which use a dying virtual tree instead of a wall

---

## What Actually Happens When You Hit a Limit

Every app that limits screen time is really two products. The first is a counter, and counters are easy. The second is the thirty seconds after the counter runs out, and that is where these apps separate.

The possibilities are narrower than the marketing suggests:

- **A dismissable notice.** Apple's Screen Time shows a limit screen with an "Ignore Limit" button. One tap and you are back.
- **A delay.** ScreenZen makes you wait, and the wait grows. one sec shows a breathing interstitial and asks whether you still want to open the app.
- **An editable budget.** Clearspace shows a pause screen, then lets you extend the budget yourself, which an independent review flags as its main structural weakness.
- **A real block.** Jomo, once Strict Mode is on, does not let you talk it out of the limit.
- **A different task.** FaithLock asks you to answer a question about a Bible verse. Clearspace has a push-up challenge.
- **A guilt trip.** Forest and Flora kill a virtual tree and leave the phone fully usable.

None of these is objectively best. What matters is which one you personally will not defeat within a week.

## How We Picked These

- **Ranked by what happens at the limit**, not by feature count. The moment of the limit is the product.
- **Mechanism named for every app.** Screen Time API, Shortcuts interstitial, accessibility service, or app-switch detection. If a source did not confirm it, we say so rather than filling the gap.
- **Weaknesses traced to a source.** Named App Store reviews, Trustpilot reviews, independent review sites, or the developer's own documentation and FAQ.
- **Prices dated.** All figures checked on 2026-08-15 against the source named beside them.

*Disclosure: this article is published on the FaithLock blog. FaithLock is described here with the same sourcing and the same limits stated as everything else.*

## The 8 Best Apps That Limit Screen Time

### 1. Apple Screen Time (built in)

**At the limit**: a full-screen notice with an "Ignore Limit" button

Already on your iPhone. Settings, Screen Time gives you per-app and per-category daily limits, Downtime windows, and a weekly usage report. It is also the framework almost every paid app below is built on.

**Worth knowing**: setting a Screen Time passcode here, ideally one someone else holds, makes every third-party app in this article significantly harder to defeat. It is the single most useful thing you can do before installing anything.

**Where it falls short**: the Ignore Limit button, which is the reason most people conclude built-in limits do not work on them.

| Detail | Info |
|---|---|
| Price | Free, built in |
| Platforms | iOS, iPadOS, macOS |
| At the limit | Dismissable notice |

---

### 2. ScreenZen

**At the limit**: the app stops opening, and getting back in means waiting

ScreenZen is free with optional donations. It sets per-app daily usage limits and blocks once the goal is reached, schedulable by day and time. Before that point it already inserts a customizable delay that grows with repeated attempts, caps session length to interrupt long scrolls, and shows reflective prompts.

**What stands out**: it is the only genuinely free option here with a limit that resists you, and the escalating delay is smart design for autopilot scrolling.

**Where it falls short**: a Trustpilot reviewer states ScreenZen sends screen recordings and third-party app activity to its servers without this being mentioned in the privacy policy, and reports receiving no response from support after asking about it. Another reports that forgetting the app passcode after enabling uninstall prevention locks you out of your settings until a paid unlock request is processed. An independent review site lists "can be bypassed" as a weak point and notes the delay loses its effect once tapping through becomes habitual.

| Detail | Info |
|---|---|
| Price | Free with optional donations |
| Platforms | iOS, iPad, macOS, Android |
| Method | Screen Time and Shortcuts permissions on iOS; Accessibility Service on Android |
| At the limit | Blocked, with escalating delays before that point |

### 3. Clearspace

**At the limit**: a forced pause screen, or a set of push-ups

Clearspace, from Clearspace Technologies, uses the Screen Time API to gate app access and assigns per-app time budgets. Before a restricted app opens you get a forced pause of one to ten minutes. An alternative unlock asks you to do push-ups, which the phone counts. Accountability partner notifications, streak reporting, and a Strict Mode lockout round it out.

**What stands out**: the push-up unlock is the most physical limit here, and few consumer apps loop in a second person at all.

**Where it falls short**: an independent review flags that users can raise their own budgets at will, calling this the app's main structural weakness, and notes accountability notifications only fire after a limit is already broken, so a partner cannot approve or refuse an override in the moment. App Store reviewers report inaccurate screen time tracking, one describing days that jump "from one hour to 20 without opening my phone," plus difficulty reaching the developers. The same reviews report the push-up challenge failing to register completed reps roughly a quarter of the time, and call Premium expensive. The free tier limits one app.

| Detail | Info |
|---|---|
| Price | Freemium (free tier blocks one app); $6.99/month, $44.99/year individual, $79.99/year family per the App Store listing checked 2026-08-15 |
| Platforms | iOS, Android, Chrome extension |
| Method | Screen Time API on iOS; Android mechanism not confirmed |
| At the limit | Pause screen of 1 to 10 minutes, or a push-up challenge |

### 4. one sec

**At the limit**: a breathing exercise, then a question

one sec, from riedel.wtf apps S.L., works per app-open rather than per day. On iOS it intercepts launches through Shortcuts automation and shows a friction interstitial: a deep breath, a reflection prompt, or a phone rotation. Then it asks whether you still want to open the app, and logs what you decide. An optional blocking mode adds scheduled full restriction, and a browser extension covers websites.

**What stands out**: it targets the reflex rather than the clock, and the journaling turns each opening into a data point rather than a failure.

**Where it falls short**: a review describes the intervention as "a speed bump, not a wall," since determined users tap through every breathing prompt without pausing. Long-term users report the pause losing its psychological impact by around week four. The free tier only fully protects one app. On Android it depends on the Accessibility Service API, which can conflict with other apps or be disabled by manufacturer battery optimization, causing inconsistent behavior.

| Detail | Info |
|---|---|
| Price | Free tier protects one app; paid subscription or one-time/family lifetime purchase reaching up to $149 per the App Store listing checked 2026-08-15 |
| Platforms | iOS, iPad, Mac, Watch, TV, Android, browser extension |
| Method | Shortcuts-based interstitial; optional scheduled blocking mode |
| At the limit | Breathing prompt, then a yes or no question |

### 5. Jomo

**At the limit**: the app is gone, and Strict Mode means gone

Jomo, from Jomo SAS, can block by schedule, by usage limit, or until you complete an action, across apps and websites in all browsers. Category blocking handles social media, games, and shopping as groups. Strict Mode turns a usage limit into a multi-day lockout with no early opt-out, and enables anti-uninstall protection while active. Analytics stay on device, and Jomo states it does not sell usage data.

**What stands out**: it is the only app here that turns a soft daily limit into something you genuinely cannot argue with.

**Where it falls short**: Jomo maintains a public troubleshooting article for blocking that fails to engage or fails to release on schedule, opening with "we understand your frustration and share it," and attributing it to conflicts with other Screen Time apps, Low Power Mode, and outdated software. A published review found the free version too limited, with scheduled sessions, advanced groupings, and usage insights paywalled, and noted Jomo cannot block Safari at the granular level Apple's own tools allow.

| Detail | Info |
|---|---|
| Price | Freemium; Jomo Plus $5.99/month, $29.99/year, $99.99 lifetime per the App Store listing checked 2026-08-15 |
| Platforms | iOS, iPad, Mac |
| Method | Apple Screen Time API |
| At the limit | Hard block; Strict Mode extends it across days with anti-uninstall |

### 6. FaithLock

**At the limit**: a Bible verse and a question about what you just read

FaithLock blocks apps through Apple's Family Controls (Screen Time) API, the same enforcement layer Jomo and Opal use. The distinctive part is the thirty seconds after the limit bites. You get a verse from the complete BSB (Berean Standard Bible) library of 31,000+ verses, then a fill-in-the-blank question about it. Answer correctly and the app opens.

Scheduled lock times cover morning devotion, work hours, and bedtime. Prayer reminders run through the day. Streak tracking with badges and a streak-freeze system records whether the limit is holding, and a home screen widget shows the verse of the day.

**What stands out**: most apps that limit screen time leave you holding an empty phone, which is precisely when people uninstall the blocker. Filling that gap with something you chose in advance is a different proposition from waiting out a timer.

**Where it falls short**: iOS only, no Android version. It is a self-accountability tool with no parental control or family account features. There are no location or Wi-Fi triggers and no calendar integration. And the mechanism only works as friction if a Bible verse is something you actually want in that moment, which rules it out for a lot of people who should pick ScreenZen or Jomo instead.

| Detail | Info |
|---|---|
| Price | Subscription with a 3-day free trial |
| Platforms | iOS |
| Method | Apple Family Controls (Screen Time) API |
| At the limit | Read a verse, answer a quiz question about it |

### 7. Forest

**At the limit**: a virtual tree dies, and nothing else happens

Forest, from SEEKRTECH, is a gamified focus timer. Start a session, a tree grows. Leave the app and it withers. Over months you build a forest that visualizes your phone-free hours. On iOS 16 and later, an optional Deep Focus feature with allowlists uses Apple's Screen Time API to add real blocking during a session. A Chrome and Firefox extension covers the computer, and the company plants real trees through a partnership with Trees for the Future.

**What stands out**: for some people, killing a tree stings in a way that ignoring a notification does not, and the accumulated forest is a genuinely motivating record.

**Where it falls short**: outside Deep Focus there is no technical barrier at all. Accept the tree's death and the phone is fully yours. There is no cross-device protection, and an article covering the app notes that even when Forest works well on the phone, nothing stops you reaching the same distractions from a laptop. Recent App Store reviews criticize the shift toward subscription, with statistics that used to be free now gated behind Forest Plus.

| Detail | Info |
|---|---|
| Price | Free with in-app purchases from $0.99 to $35.99, including Forest Plus around $5.99/month or $32.49 to $35.99/year, per the App Store checked 2026-08-15 |
| Platforms | iOS, Android, browser extension |
| Method | Gamified app-switch detection; optional Screen Time API Deep Focus on iOS 16+ |
| At the limit | The tree dies; the phone stays usable |

### 8. Flora

**At the limit**: the same tree, with friends watching

Flora, from AppFinca, works on the same honesty principle as Forest. A session grows a virtual tree, leaving the app kills it, and a Pause option lets you step away without penalty. On iOS 16.1 and later, an allowlist exempts chosen apps from the detection. Flora adds a built-in to-do list, habit tracking, multiplayer challenges where a group plants together, and real tree planting through partners including Trees.org and Eden Reforestation Projects.

**What stands out**: the multiplayer challenge is the strongest social pressure in this list, and it costs almost nothing.

**Where it falls short**: nothing is technically blocked; the phone stays fully usable throughout. Flora's own FAQ acknowledges trees killed by mistake through "false detections" attributed to iOS limitations, with a dedicated process for getting them restored, and recommends manual workarounds rather than guaranteeing reliable detection. Users report the allow-background-apps feature as broken, and App Store reviews describe the friends and progress interface as glitchy.

| Detail | Info |
|---|---|
| Price | Free with in-app purchases; Flora Care $1.99/year, a $9.99 tier that plants a real tree every 24 cumulative focus hours, and tours at $0.99 or $1.99, per the App Store checked 2026-08-15 |
| Platforms | iOS, Android |
| Method | App-switch detection and gamification |
| At the limit | The tree dies, visible to your group |

## Which One Should You Install

**You have never set a limit at all**: Apple Screen Time, this week, for free. Then read the report.

**You set limits and ignore them**: Jomo. Its Strict Mode is the only thing here that removes the argument.

**You want a limit that holds and refuse to pay**: ScreenZen.

**Your problem is reflex, not volume**: one sec.

**You want the reclaimed minutes to go somewhere specific**: FaithLock, if that somewhere is Scripture.

**Rules make you dig in, but you hate letting things die**: Forest, or Flora if you want a group involved.

**You want a person, not an app, holding you to it**: Clearspace comes closest, though its notifications arrive after the fact rather than in the moment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the best app that limits screen time on iPhone?**
For a limit you cannot argue your way past, Jomo with Strict Mode. For a free option that still resists you, ScreenZen. For a limit that hands you something to do instead of an empty phone, FaithLock. Apple's built-in Screen Time is the right free starting point, but most people tap through its Ignore Limit button within a week.

**Is there a free app that limits screen time?**
Yes. Apple's Screen Time is free and built in. ScreenZen is free with optional donations and adds escalating delays and session caps that Apple's version does not have. Forest and Flora both have usable free tiers, though neither blocks anything technically.

**Can I set a screen time limit I cannot remove myself?**
Close to it. Jomo's Strict Mode runs a multi-day lockout with anti-uninstall protection and no early opt-out. The bigger lever on iPhone is setting a Screen Time passcode you do not know, which is why most people ask a partner or friend to enter it. Opal's help center and Freedom's docs both confirm their locks are weaker without one.

**Why do screen time limits stop working after a few weeks?**
Because the friction becomes familiar. A review of one sec found long-term users reporting the breathing pause turning into an annoying formality by around week four, and an independent review of ScreenZen notes the same effect once tapping through becomes habitual. Limits that change (escalating delays, a question you have to answer, a different verse each time) tend to hold longer than a fixed prompt.

**Do these apps work for limiting a child's screen time?**
Not really. The tools above are self-accountability apps and a determined teenager will find Settings, Screen Time. Apple's own Family Sharing restrictions and dedicated parental tools are the right category. See our guide to the [best Christian parental control apps](/resources/best-christian-parental-control-apps).

---

## Final Thoughts

If you want one recommendation and no further reading: install ScreenZen, and set a Screen Time passcode you do not control. That combination costs nothing and is stronger than most of the paid options on their own.

If you have already been through three of these apps and uninstalled all of them, the pattern is usually not that the limit was too weak. It is that the limit worked, the phone went quiet, and there was nothing waiting in the quiet. That is a different problem, and an app with a bigger lock will not solve it.
