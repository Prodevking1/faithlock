    "shortDefinition": "Phone addiction (nomophobia) is a behavioral disorder characterized by compulsive smartphone use that interferes with daily life, relationships, and spiritual growth. Affects 57% of Americans according to 2026 studies.",
    "detailedExplanation": "<p>Phone addiction, clinically known as nomophobia (no-mobile-phone phobia), represents a modern behavioral challenge affecting millions. It's characterized by:</p><ul><li>Checking phone 144-186 times per day on average</li><li>Anxiety when separated from device</li><li>Interference with work, relationships, and spiritual practices</li><li>Inability to resist the urge to check notifications</li></ul><p>The American Psychological Association reports 57% of Americans admit to phone addiction, with Millennials showing the highest rate at 47%.</p>",
    "christianPerspective": "<p>From a Christian perspective, phone addiction represents a form of modern idolatry—allowing technology to steal time and attention meant for God, family, and purposeful living.</p><p>The issue isn't the phone itself, but how it replaces spiritual disciplines, prayer time, and genuine human connection. Many Christians report wanting to pray but scrolling instead, losing hours that could be devoted to spiritual growth.</p>",

    "detailedExplanation": "<p>Nomophobia describes the irrational fear of being without your mobile phone or unable to use it (due to signal loss, battery death, etc.). The term was coined in 2008 and has become increasingly relevant as smartphone dependency grows.</p><p>Symptoms include: panic attacks when phone is misplaced, constantly checking for messages, never turning phone off, taking phone to bathroom, and anxiety when battery is low.</p>",
    "christianPerspective": "<p>For Christians, nomophobia reveals a deeper spiritual issue: misplaced trust and security. When we find our peace in constant connectivity rather than in God's presence, we've created a false refuge.</p><p>The anxiety nomophobia produces stands in direct contrast to the peace Christ offers.
